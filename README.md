# Control base interface of the fighting robot
Design the interface to the control base of the fighting robot using web languages.

I Built a User interface that contains the buttons of the control base to control the robot base of the fighting robot, which has five buttons of directions, each button expresses a specific direction, left, right, forward, backward, and stop.

Each button will store the values of his direction in the database which I created. like the Left button will store the value name "Left". Also, I created a PHP page to return the last values of the direction chosen by the user and store them in the databases.

**The control base interface :**

**Here, when we press on any of the directions buttons its will store the value of that button in the database :**
